The assignment is to create an HTML and CSS file for the [Surf & Paddle design](surf-and-paddle.png).
- This homework will be due on Monday at 9am
- You can use any images you'd like for the design (even http://placekitten.com !)
- It should be a pixel perfect recreation of the design and layout. (I will be overlaying the image over your site to check if it's a perfect match.)
- All anchor and image hover effects should use the `transition` property.
